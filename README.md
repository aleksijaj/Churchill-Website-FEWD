Rationale
In this assignment, the brief explained that the task was to create a responsive website for the Churchill House. We were provided with content including text and images. This assignment was simply for us to focus on the code and further our knowledge on the different programs that were available to us. With all the information provided to us through Canvas and in tutorials, there was enough given information to be able to create a simple website. 
When I think of the Churchill House, I think of neutral colours and parallel lines. My goal for the website was to create something very simple and easy for any interactive user to navigate their way around the website without it being too confusing. 
In project 1, we had the task of creating an inspiration board to get our minds thinking about what our website could look like. After reading the brief multiple times, I created an inspiration board that I believe would suit any age and would keep them in the loop of the direction of the website, even though I have changed some elements for the final outcome. 

The Header & Navigation: 
	The header on the homepage was created to identify what the website is about. I recognise it is simple, but I believe it is affective because it caters to every age group. I decided to create a white background of “Churchill House” because it stands out. The navigation was inspired by websites that have the hover effect to let the user know that they can click on it and they are at the right location should they want to click onto another page with their desired information on it. I included this in my website design because again, it is easy to navigate. 
Colour Palette & Fonts:
	The colours that I chose for the whole website was a neutral palette. This was done because it is not harsh on the eyes and brings a warming sensation to the screen. These colours are not strong and obnoxious that could possibly create a confronting experience to some users. I have also chosen these colours to suit people that may have vision impairments. The font chosen for all content in the website was chosen because they are neat and easy on the eye. 
Footer:
	I knew I wanted the footer to be a completely different colour compared to the main content of the website. I used this technique because I believe it notifies the user the end of the page has been reached. Sort of like a dead end. I repeated the links in the footer for the other links in the website for easy access if the user is at the bottom of the page. 
Main Content:
	The focus for me for the main content on the site was for it to be simple and easy to follow. I did this for the user’s benefit to ensure they are able to experience the website for what it is meant for and that it for information about the Churchill House. My aim for the website was simplicity and minimalism.
